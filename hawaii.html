			<p>Hawaii is a great place to enjoy amazing scenery. It's perfect for people who love the great outdoors. Manoa Falls is a popular trail among both tourist and locals, but if you're in for a challenge, <em>The Stairway to Heaven</em> is the hike for you. There's many beaches and hikes to explore while you're here!</p>

			<p>Locals and tourists love getting fresh poke bowls and garlic shrimp plates! Kalua pork, chicken long rice, and poke are some of my favorite traditional Hawaiian dishes. Hawaii is actually a very diverse place, so you can also find plenty of authentic asian food here. </p>
